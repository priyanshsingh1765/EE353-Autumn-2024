# EDA
- First and foremost, analysis of all the useful columns was to be done
- There was no column of ZIP codes in the housing projects dataset, ZIP codes had to be extracted from the project address column
- Then a serach for nan/empty cells was conducted, replacing empty cells with appropriate values, if possible

# Summarizing by ZIP using SQL
## Restaurant dataset
- Score (Mean, Max, Min) 
## Housing dataset
- Construction type (Argmax)
- Site units (Mean, Max, Min) 
- Project total units (Mean, Max, Min)
- Housing type (Argmax)
- Time to get in service (Mean, Max, Min)
